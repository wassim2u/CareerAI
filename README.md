# InVision | Gemini Competition API 

## Local Development

For the application to run, it needs to be launched locally for the time being. 
You need to launch three things:  Flutter Frontend, Flask Backend, and React Frontend.



## To run the Python app
Libraries: 
- Conda

  
Install the libraries using 
- `conda env create -n CareerAITest2 -f environment.yml`
- `pip install flask flask_restful flask_cors pandas`
- `pip install google-generativeai google-api-python-client  firebase_admin pillow`
- `pip install .` from the root page
- In the terminal, `export GOOGLE_API_KEY=Your_API_Key` to use the Gemini Functionality

## To run the Flutter application
>> Go To UI/flutter_app
`flutter run -d chrome`
or
`flutter run --profile -d chrome` for a faster User experience.
